## Tweenity Graph Editor - UI Documentation

### Overview
The **Tweenity Graph Editor** is a custom Unity Editor Window designed to manage and visualize node-based structures within the Unity Editor. The interface has been modularized into distinct components for maintainability and ease of extension.

### Components
The editor consists of five key sections:

#### 1. **Toolbar (TweenityToolbar.cs)**
- Provides essential file operations and view settings.
- Buttons include:
  - **File Menu** (Save, Export, Import)
  - **View Menu** (Toggle Grid, Zoom In/Out, Reset View)
  - **Help Button** (Placeholder for documentation/help support)
  - **Add Node Button** (Future functionality for adding nodes)

#### 2. **Left Panel (TweenityLeftPanel.cs)**
- Contains tools for managing the hierarchy and searching nodes.
- Includes:
  - **Search Bar** (Filter nodes by name)
  - **Hierarchy View** (Displays node structure)

#### 3. **Graph View (TweenityGraphView.cs)**
- The core visual representation of nodes and their relationships.
- Allows interaction with nodes and connections (future development planned).

#### 4. **Right Panel (TweenityRightPanel.cs)**
- Displays details and properties of the selected node.
- Contains:
  - **Node Type Dropdown** (Allows selection of node category)
  - **Title & Description Fields**
  - **Expected User Actions**
  - **Simulator Actions**
  - **Timeout & Reminder Settings**
  - **Audio & Dialogue Settings** (Visible only for dialogue nodes)
  - **Connected Nodes List**

#### 5. **Bottom Toolbar (TweenityBottomToolbar.cs)**
- Displays debugging and selection information.
- Includes:
  - **Debugging Button** (Logs debugging information)
  - **Current Selection Button** (Shows details of the currently selected node)

### Functionality & Behavior
- The **Toolbar** handles general actions (file management, view controls, node addition).
- The **Left Panel** organizes nodes in a hierarchical manner and allows searching.
- The **Graph View** is the interactive space where users manipulate nodes.
- The **Right Panel** updates dynamically based on the selected node type.
- The **Bottom Toolbar** is used for debugging and tracking selections.

This document provides a structured overview of the Tweenity Graph Editor's UI components and functionality as of the current implementation.
